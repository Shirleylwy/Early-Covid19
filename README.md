# From Epidemic to Pandemic: the Impact of COVID-19 Policies on Global Outbreaks 

### Introduction  
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every corner of the globe since it was first identified in December 2019. Countries have implemented various policies to try to control the spread of the virus, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mask mandates. But how effective have these policies been in reducing the number of cases and deaths?  

In this project, we'll use data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering to explore the impact of COVID-19 policies on global outbreaks. We'll analyze the trends in case numbers and deaths across different countries and regions, and compare these to the timing and severity of policy interventions.  

### Analyzing COVID-19 Data  
We'll start by visualizing COVID-19 data from the first several weeks of the outbreak to see at what point the virus became a global pandemic. We'll explore the patterns of spread across different countries and regions, and look for any notable differences in policy interventions.  

Next, we'll examine the effectiveness of different policies in controlling the spread of the virus. We'll look at case and death rates before and after policy interventions, and compare these to countries that implemented different policies or no policies at all.  

Finally, we'll consider the broader implications of our findings for policymakers and public health officials. We'll highlight the most effective policies for controlling the spread of COVID-19, and provide recommendations for future pandemic response efforts.  

By the end of this analysis, you'll have a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 policies on global outbreaks, and the strategies that have been most effective in controlling the spread of the virus.
